## Wi-Fi-Based Approaches

Wi-Fi monitoring and fingerprinting are techniques used to gather information about wireless networks, but they differ in purpose, methodology, and application.

### Wi-Fi Monitoring

- Main Idea: Wi-Fi monitoring involves passively observing and capturing Wi-Fi traffic (data packets) in the surrounding environment. This includes analyzing signals from access points (APs) and devices, such as SSIDs, signal strength, channel usage, and even packet contents (if not encrypted).
- Purpose: It's typically used for network troubleshooting, performance optimization, and security auditing.
- How It Works: A Wi-Fi adapter is set to monitor mode, allowing it to capture all wireless traffic in range, even if not destined for the monitoring device.
- Applications:
  - Analyzing traffic patterns and identifying potential interference.

### Wi-Fi Fingerprinting

- Main Idea: Wi-Fi fingerprinting involves mapping and storing unique characteristics (or "fingerprints") of Wi-Fi signals at different locations to determine a device's location or context later.
- Purpose: It's primarily used for location-based services and indoor positioning systems (IPS).
- How It Works:
  - Offline phase: Wi-Fi signals (like Received Signal Strength Indicator, or RSSI) are measured and recorded at various locations to create a "radio map."
  - Online phase: The current Wi-Fi signal characteristics are compared to the radio map to estimate the device's location.
- Applications:
  - Indoor navigation and wayfinding (e.g., in malls, airports).
  - Asset tracking in warehouses.
  - Context-aware services like smart lighting or targeted advertisements.

### Key Differences

| Aspect                | Wi-Fi Monitoring                      | Wi-Fi Fingerprinting                 |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Objective         | Traffic analysis, security, and troubleshooting | Location determination               |
| Methodology       | Passive traffic capture and analysis   | Signal characteristic mapping and matching |
| Scope             | Focuses on network behavior and devices | Focuses on spatial signal patterns   |
| Output            | Data about devices, networks, and traffic | Estimated location or spatial context |

In summary, Wi-Fi monitoring observes and analyzes Wi-Fi traffic for network insights, while Wi-Fi fingerprinting leverages signal characteristics to provide location-based information.
