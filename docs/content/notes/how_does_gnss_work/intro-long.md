## Introduction

The Global Positioning System (**GPS**), also known as the NAVigation Satellite Time And Ranging (**NAVSTAR**) system had its first satellite launched back in February 1978. GPS is a *one-­way* radio ranging system which provides real­time knowledge of one’s Position and Velocity, and a very accurate Time reference as well (all together referred to as **PVT**).

Below are the 4 constellations of GNSS systems:

* **Global Positioning System (GPS)** \- United States
  * *Standard Positioning Service (SPS)*
  * *Precise Positioning Service (PPS)*
* **GLONASS** \- Russia
* **Galileo** \- Europe
  * *Open service (OS)*
  * *Public regulated service (PRS)*
