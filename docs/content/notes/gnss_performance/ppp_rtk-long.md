## PPP & RTK

### PPP

Precise Point Positioning (PPP) is a GNSS signal augmentation technique that offers high accuracy positioning using a single receiver. The errors which PPP corrected:

- satellite errors
  - SV Orbit error
  - SV Clock error
  - SV Bias

#### Key features of PPP

- **Does not resolve carrier phase ambiguities**  
    Instead, it uses an estimation, leading to a longer initialization time and requiring full re-initialization if the signal is lost. This is a key difference from RTK, which uses carrier phase measurements for precise positioning.
- **Eliminates GNSS system errors**  
    PPP uses GNSS satellite clock and orbit corrections to achieve high-accuracy positioning without needing a local base station. PPP typically offers a decimetre accuracy (10 cm).
- **Relies on a global network of Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS)**  
    These stations generate the corrections needed to eliminate system errors.
- **Delivers corrections via satellite or internet**  
    This allows for global coverage and removes the need for local infrastructure.
- **Provides dm-level or better real-time positioning**  
    This accuracy surpasses standalone GNSS capabilities, making it suitable for applications requiring higher precision.
- **Requires a convergence period**  
    Typically ranging from 5 to 30 minutes, this time is needed to resolve local biases such as atmospheric conditions, multipath, and satellite geometry.
- **Uses the State Space Representation (SSR) message format**  
    This format separates and corrects individual error components, unlike OSR used in RTK.
- **Suitable for applications with no local infrastructure**  
    Ex: sparsely populated areas and marine applications where setting up a network of base stations is challenging.

While PPP offers global coverage and good accuracy, its long convergence times can be a drawback for applications that require rapid positioning. Nonetheless, it's a valuable technique for situations where high accuracy is needed without relying on local base stations.

### RTK

RTK, which utilises the OSR approach, corrects for location-dependent errors like Ionospheric and Tropospheric delays by providing a localized solution based on a network of base stations (CORS). The errors which RTK corrected:

- satellite errors
  - SV Orbit error
  - SV Clock error
  - SV Bias
- location-dependent errors
  - Ionospheric delay
  - Tropospheric delay

#### Key features of RTK

- **RTK enables the rover to resolve the ambiguities of the differenced carrier phase data and estimate the coordinates of the rover position.**
- **A CORS transmits its raw measurements or observation corrections to a rover receiver.**  
    This is done via a direct (two-way) communication channel. The rover is a potentially moving receiver whose position is being determined.
- **Very high accuracy positioning over a short range (30–50 km).**  
    This is due to the degradation of distance-dependent biases, such as orbit error and ionospheric and tropospheric signal refraction.
- **Within close proximities of the base station (10–20 km), RTK provides near-instant high accuracy positioning of up to 1 cm + 1 ppm.**
- **A direct communication channel is required between the rover and the base station.**  
    Bandwidth limitations prevent large numbers of users utilising the same base station, making RTK ill-suited to mass-market applications.
- **RTK is the most popular GNSS signal augmentation technology.**  
    It is used in industries such as surveying and agriculture, and is especially common in regions with well-developed CORS networks.
- **RTK uses the Observation Space Representation (OSR) approach.**  
    This groups the errors together and provides the total correction measurements, rather than for the individual parameters. All parameters are updated at the same frequency regardless of their time sensitivity.

#### OSR Approach

The OSR approach (and thus RTK) has high bandwidth requirements because:

- **It requires a two-way communication channel for each user.**  
    Both the base station and the rover need to transmit data back and forth, increasing the amount of data being transferred.
- **OSR groups errors together and provides total correction measurements.**  
    Instead of sending corrections for individual parameters separately, OSR sends all the corrections together. This leads to a larger data packet size compared to SSR, which separates individual error components.
- **All parameters are updated at the same frequency.**  
    Regardless of the time sensitivity of each parameter, they are all updated at the same rate (the most time-sensitive one), leading to more frequent data transmissions and increased bandwidth usage.

The high bandwidth requirement of OSR is a major limitation, particularly for mass-market applications. If a large number of users were to utilise the OSR approach, current mobile networks would likely be overwhelmed. This is why OSR is not well-suited for applications like smartphones, IoT, and the automotive industry.

### PPP-RTK

PPP-RTK is a hybrid GNSS signal augmentation technology that combines the strengths of both Precise Point Positioning (PPP) and Real-Time Kinematic (RTK). Here's a breakdown of its key features:

- **Utilises a network of CORS stations**  
    Similar to RTK, it relies on a network of Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) to generate corrections.
- **Provides atmospheric error corrections**  
    PPP-RTK utilises a "un-differenced" map of atmospheric errors generated by a network of CORS, specifically for ionospheric and tropospheric delays, which are calculated using the CORS network. Achieving fast ambiguity resolution and high accuracy.
- **Enables fast convergence times**  
    Thanks to the atmospheric error corrections, convergence times are significantly reduced, typically in the range of 1-10 minutes and potentially within seconds under ideal conditions.
- **Delivers cm-level accuracy**  
    Comparable to traditional RTK techniques, PPP-RTK can achieve centimetre-level accuracy, exceeding the performance of standalone PPP.
- **Employs the State Space Representation (SSR) message format**  
    Unlike RTK, which uses OSR, PPP-RTK uses SSR to broadcast corrections. This allows for efficient data transmission and enables an unlimited number of users to connect without overloading the system.
- **Has lower bandwidth requirements than RTK**  
    The use of SSR and the efficient transmission of corrections result in significantly lower bandwidth requirements compared to RTK, making it suitable for mass-market applications.
- **Offers global coverage with graceful degradation**  
    While it requires a regional CORS network, if a user moves beyond its range, the service seamlessly transitions to standard PPP, ensuring continuous positioning capability.

**Overall, PPP-RTK offers a promising solution for mass-market applications by providing high accuracy, fast convergence, global coverage, and efficient bandwidth usage.**  
It bridges the gap between traditional PPP and RTK, offering a more versatile and scalable approach to high-accuracy positioning.

**OSR vs. SSR:**

- **OSR:** Groups errors together, requires **two-way communication**, higher bandwidth requirements.
- **SSR:** Separates individual error components, enables efficient data transmission, **one-way communication (broadcast)**, lower bandwidth requirements.

The choice depends on the application's needs and available infrastructure.
