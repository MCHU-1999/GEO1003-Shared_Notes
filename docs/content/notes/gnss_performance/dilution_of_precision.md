## Dilution of Precision

The geometry of the visible satellites affects accuracy. Poor satellite geometry (e.g. satellites clustered together) increases DOP, leading to less precise positioning. Good geometry (satellites spread out) reduces DOP and improves accuracy.

inaccuracy of computed position = DOP x Inaccuracy of range measurement

If DOP is very high, the inaccuracy of the computed position will be much larger than the inaccuracy of the range measurement

Types of DOP:
HDOP (Horizontal Dilution of Precision)
VDOP (Vertical Dilution of Precision)
PDOP (Position Dilution of Precision)

DOP values impact accuracy, with high DOP leading to poor precision Impact of satellite position: DOP values change with time of day and location. For example, in high-latitude areas or urban environments, low satellite positions can lead to poor DOP and lower positioning accuracy.
